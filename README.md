## microbe

__microbe__ relies on [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), [Git](http://git-scm.com) 
and [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/) to provide a simple management tool especialls√Ω for Github-hosted 
[Vim](http://www.vim.org) plugins.

Requires Bash, cURL, Vim and Git.

__NOTE__: If you are looking for a command line tool that is able to handle more than just Git-hosted
Plugins, you might want to have a look at [vim-pandemic](https://github.com/jwcxz/vim-pandemic). It is,
due to its capabilities, obviously a little more verbose than microbe (oh, how the names fit!) but looks 
rather usable. Not a command line tool but very powerful in the same domain is 
[neobundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim).

## Premise

__microbe__  is all about minimalism. It reduces the size of plugins by only retaining necessary 
data (or rather discarding obviously unnecessary one) and offers ways for multiple users to
fetch plugins from a single central directory. The command line interface resembles that of `apt-get`,
hopefully making usage intuitive and concise.

## Installation

Current stable Version: __0.2.0__

__User Installation__

```
mkdir ~/.bin
curl -fkLo "~/.bin/microbe" "https://raw.github.com/xsc/microbe-vim/stable/src/microbe.sh" 
chmod +x ~/.bin/microbe
```

Make sure to add `~/.bin` to your `$PATH`, e.g. using `export PATH="$PATH:~/.bin"` in your
`~/.bashrc`.

__System-wide Installation__

```
sudo curl -fkLo "/usr/bin/microbe" "https://raw.github.com/xsc/microbe-vim/stable/src/microbe.sh" 
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/microbe
```

## Usage

```
microbe <command> [<parameters>]
```

__Commands__

- `help`: show usage information
- `version`: show version
- `update-pathogen`: update pathogen to the most recent version
- `install [<GitHub User>] <plugin>`: clone the given plugin and add its contents to pathogen's include path
- `remove [<GitHub User>] <plugin>`: remove the given plugin from pathogen's include path
- `purge [<GitHub User>] <plugin>`: remove the given plugin from the machine
- `update [<GitHub User>] [<plugin>]`: update all plugins or the given one
- `list`: list all repositories maintained by microbe and whether they are used by the current user

If no GitHub user is given, `vim-scripts` will be used. Also, for a given `<plugin>` both repositories 
`<user>/<plugin>` and `<user>/<plugin>.vim` will be checked. 

__NOTE__ : It is necessary to match the repository name's case, since `git clone` seems to be case-sensitive, at
least when cloning from GitHub.

## Settings

You can create a file `~/.microbe.conf` that contains key/value pairs:

```
REPO=~/.microbe      # Directory for Git Clones
VERBOSE=yes          # If set to "no", most output will be suppressed
DEBUG=no             # If set to "yes", additional information will be printed
COLORS=yes           # If set to "no", output will not be colorized
```

The same key/value pairs can be given before calling microbe, e.g.:

```
$ COLORS=no microbe list
```

The `REPO` option is very useful if you have a central directory accessible by all
Vim users, either on the same machine or via some network file system, preventing
multiple downloads or updates of the same data.
